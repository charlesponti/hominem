I graduated as Master of Science in Leisure Studies and Master of Arts in European Urban Cultures in 2009 after studying in Tilburg, Brussels, Manchester and Helsinki, with strong interest in Sports, Tourism, Urban Regeneration and Creative Spaces.\n\nUpon my return to Suriname, I got involved in Social Media and Online Marketing, and have now worked in this field as lecturer, trainer, strategist, campaign specialist, manager and creator for over 12 years. I'm a HootSuite, Coosto and Hubspot Certified Professional and two-time \u2018Communication Professional of the Year\u2019 nominee. \n\nAs an entrepreneur, I co-founded five start ups in the past 10 years, most notably INEFFABLE NV, a Social Media Agency founded in 2016 that helps organizations communicate with their clients in a relatable way. The company has helped over one hundred organizations and individuals with their Social Media presence and organizes the annual Social Media Conference Suriname, which attracted over 400 participants in 2022.\n\nI'm a Global Shapers alumni and a Paul Harris Fellow at the Rotary Club of Paramaribo, where I mainly focus on committees that include education and youth development. As of 2013, I was appointed as the chairman of the Surifesta Foundation, focusing on the support of the Owru Yari celebrations as a tourism product for Suriname. My biggest pride is the Future Leaders and Entrepreneurs Program, a yearly program that provides young talents and professionals between the ages 15 and 24 with Leadership and Entrepreneurship training, which was financed through crowdfunding the first 3 years and is now been made sustainable through the support of its alumni, allowing me to fulfill my life purpose of empowering talent to reach its potential.\n\nAs Covid hit every part of the globe, I was introduced to Streamyard. I now host 2 podcasts, 'Social Confoes', a social conversation with interesting guests in English every Tuesday and the 'Loeki Di Show' a sports program in Dutch every Thursday.\n\nIn 2017, I got introduced to Web3 and have been enthusiastic about the future possibilities ever since. In 2020, I co-founded #HiveChat, a weekly Tweetchat about Hive (a blockchain based ecosystem), that has been running every Tuesday with rotating hosts for the last 2+ years."

At the tender age of five, much to my parent\u2019s dismay, I would show up at the neighbor\u2019s doorstep with a dustpan and broom offering to clean. Throughout my childhood, I would constantly be organizing the closets, drawers, and cabinets in our house. \n\nIt made perfect sense that I would end up in the field of accounting where I worked for thirteen years. I retired so that I could be home with our children and entered the world of direct sales. \n\nThat is when everything changed! As my children grew, and my business flourished, I lost my parents within weeks of each other. Now my once-organized home and business were in chaos. Trying to manage a home, business and life became a struggle. Hours of research helped me get back on track and led me on the path to helping others get organized. I started The Sensible Organizer in 2006 to help others bring calm to their chaos and never looked back."

I have worked nature folklore through folk drama, larger theatre, songs and music, storytelling, speaking engagements, workshops, guided tours, retreats, and we had our own visitor's centre in Co. Sligo, Ireland,for 12 years. \n\nI look forward to your offerings, and hopefully as a guest soon. Many thanks for reading this invitation"

Allowing them to promote things that they are working on or sometimes we will just sit and chat and engage with the fans in the chat, allowing them to ask us questions. We tried allowing fans from the chat to come on camera with us. But we learned the hard way that that is not the best idea. I won't go into detail as to what happened but let's just say that it wasn't the most pleasant. \n\nIf the guests have something that they want to promote we will ask them to send us the link to said product so that we can put it into the description of the stream. And in a ticker that will scroll across the screen while the show is live and during the replay. We ask that our guests be over the age of 18 as our primary target audience is adults."

She is in a constant state of learning and then expanding on her teachings with a vast number of certifications. She holds expertise in everything from time technique, emotional freedom techniques and Nero-linguistic programing to professional life skills, Obtaining Mastery Method Life Coaching and many more. \n\nSabrina has submerged herself in the world of entrepreneurship and business. She teaches a very structured and organized way of getting your business running in the right direction. Concentrating mostly on your ability to focus and guide your energy toward the priorities that will create the most amount of abundance in your life and business. She is a straight shooter and the exact woman you need on your side to get your business to the next level. \n\nPast:\nAs an empath and serial people pleaser, she was always looking for the solution to everyone\u2019s problems, and that attribute eventually became the catalyst for her own survival.\n\u00a0\nSabrina always had a burning desire to create, to write, to imagine and to rise above who she was. However, it would take her 28 years to finally see, feel and hear her voice.\n\u00a0\nSabrina was born and raised in the suburbs of Chicago under a patriarchal roof with a strong religious backing (Jehovah's Witness). She was raised to obey and keep any outlier thoughts to herself. Because of this, she acted out in subtle ways, which aggravated her parents, and probably still does.\n\u00a0\nSabrina moved out at age 18, to find her independence. However, ended up back at her parents house at age 20 and shortly there after, pregnant. At which point, she left their home again in order to cushion the shame of having a pregnant unwed daughter bringing humiliation upon their name.\n\u00a0\nIn 2004, her son Elijah was born, and this created a whirl wind of struggles and challenges that she was unable to foresee. Not only was she fighting off an identity of what it meant to be a single mother, but she was also broke.\n\u00a0\nNever having the chance to exercise her voice at home, she failed at communicating boundaries, confrontations and wound up playing the victim roll for the next 7 years of her life."

She can be heard regularly on Comedian Earthquake\u2019s Quake\u2019s House on Kevin Hart\u2019s LOL Network along with her album \u201cOh Yeah, Girl!\u201d playing across the LOL Network, She Funny and Raw Dawg channels. She is also featured on The Comedy Juice Clean Comedy Album: Volume 1 playing on multiple stations on Sirius XM. \n\nHer standup is hilarious. Her hosting is God sent. As a headliner, you get both! Voted One of the Top 35+ Funniest Black Female Comedians in America by Ranker.com 3 years in a row (in the same list as Wanda Sykes and Tiffany Haddish), Del keeps audiences laughing and coming back for more with her autobiographical recount of her life events and spot-on observations. She might even sing! Her talent is multifaceted and her sketches are viral.  Del\u2019s sketches have been viewed by millions, collaborating with top influencers, and writing in and starring in her own. In fact, Del spoofed Queen of Comedy, Mo\u2019Nique, in a gut-busting sketch that went viral and Mo\u2019Nique thought it was so funny, she called Del the next day and eventually invited her to be on The Mo\u2019Nique Show.\n\nThis landed Del her first late night television standup comedy debut on BET\u2019s The Mo\u2019Nique Show. Since then, Del has been a series regular on Laffmobb\u2019s Lafftracks on HBO Max and Laughs on FOX. She has made comedy appearances on Gotham Comedy Live on AXS, Wendy Williams, Roland Martin on TV One, WETV\u2019s Cinematherapy and Dr. Oz. In 2020, Del was tapped as Host of the talk show, Let\u2019s Talk Hair which aired on FOX Soul in 2021 and now, Del hosts her own radio show every Sunday on New York\u2019s newest R&B station 108 Soul FM on iHeartRadio. We can go on and on about Del but Paul Mooney said it best, \u201cDel Harrison has the IT FACTOR!\"\n\nStandup comedy birthed Del\u2019s entertainment life but in 2010, Del burst onto the music scene reminding fans of Angie Stone, Chaka & Lauryn Hill with her rapsy & soulful voice. Her first single Boom Boom spent 30 weeks in the Top #10 spot on Reverb Nation's LA Dance Charts.  She is perfect an after work party, galas and clubs being able to croon her soulful ballads or make everyone hit the dance floor with her EDM hits and funky covers.\n\nOriginally from New Orleans, raised in DC & trained in Brooklyn, Del now makes her home in LA. Her newest release \u201cNever Give Up\u201d crosses genres and has been played on 102.3 KJLH Los Angeles, 97.5 KDEE FM Sacramento, iHeartRadio weekly, Soul Groove FM UK, Caribou Radio Jamaica, Groover Radio."

Os v\u00eddeos j\u00e1 publicados no site www.youtube.com/c/CarlosOtavioSchneider demonstram o toer do combate, visando inserir no mercado de trabalho todos os diplomados nas Institui\u00e7\u00f5es de Ensino Superior no Brasil e que sejam portadores de diplomas legalmente reconhecidos pelo Estado Brasileiro atrav\u00e9s do Minist\u00e9rio da Educa\u00e7\u00e3o - MEC, direito este, usurpado pelo Parlamento Brasileiro, ao editar uma Lei inconstitucional e Ilegal, tendo em vista que o Estatuto da Advocacia foi elaborado pela Ordem dos Advogados do Brasil - OAB, tendo tramitado somente na CCJ da C\u00e2mara e na CCJ do Senado, sem que houvesse vota\u00e7\u00e3o nas respectivas casas legislativas. Ademais, a san\u00e7\u00e3o presidencial da Lei 8.906/1994 foi firmada por um presidente (Itamar Franco) que teve sua assinatura falsificada, o que torna o instituto imprest\u00e1vel para o direito Brasileiro, tudo comprovado por pareceres t\u00e9cnicos, atestado por peritos. Por outro lado, a Ordem dos Advogados do Brasil - OAB, \u00e9 uma entidade supostamente representante dos advogados brasileiros, criada pelo artigo 17 do Decerto 19.408/1930 e cujo Decreto 11/1991, Anexo IV extinguiu a referida entidade nunca mais tendo sido criada. Contudo vige no mundo do Direito de fato mas n\u00e3o de Direito. Por fim, o desrespeito a Lei 12.605/2012, que determina que as institui\u00e7\u00f5es de ensino superior expe\u00e7a os diplomas dos formados, contendo a flex\u00e3o de \"G\u00eanero\" do formado ou da formada, a \"Profiss\u00e3o\" e o \"Grau obtido\". Contudo, desde o ano de 2012, a referida lei inserida no ordenamento jur\u00eddico, se tornou letra morta para o nosso pa\u00eds. A OCDE vem ao encontro dos prop\u00f3sitos da ANB a quem nos juntamos para oportunizar oportunidades ao exerc\u00edcio profissional, sem limita\u00e7\u00f5es rasas."

Es un ser humano excepcional, ciudadano del mundo, que cuenta con un desconcertante caudal de conocimientos, en algunos casos adquiridos, en otros innatos. Ya desde su m\u00e1s tierna infancia demostr\u00f3 un extremado arrobamiento por lo inexplicable, lo misterioso y lo desconocido en el espacio terrenal y sideral. Estudi\u00f3 en Espa\u00f1a, Inglaterra y los Estados Unidos. Al inicio de los a\u00f1os 70, se destaca por su filarmon\u00eda o pasi\u00f3n por la m\u00fasica, este sentimiento intr\u00ednseco, y perpetuado por su locuacidad al hablar, le ha dado un exquisito y subliminal estilo a la hora de escribir y componer temas musicales. Asimismo, el acaudalado c\u00famulo de palabras, que \u00e9l solo aprendi\u00f3 a convertir en prosa le da una prosapia natural y espont\u00e1nea a todos sus escritos, m\u00e1s de 40 libros, todos disponibles en Amazon, entre ellos: El Manifiesto Que, Cincuenta D\u00edas de Oto\u00f1o (colecci\u00f3n de poemas), Para la Vida en la UNICEF y la UNESCO, Pensaciertos, 7 veces 7, Mensajeros de la Luz, la colecci\u00f3n de las Transcripciones de A1, El Libro de la Vida, TDAH/ADD \u00bfD\u00e9ficit o Super\u00e1vit? Bullying, el ni\u00f1o acorralado, Ouxrz, Atlas de la Medicina natural, Resonando con Marte, Den Sheram, Psicolog\u00eda Espiritual, Las moradas interiores, etc. adem\u00e1s de un sinn\u00famero de art\u00edculos en peri\u00f3dicos y revistas locales, nacionales e internacionales.\n\nPor sus dotes de magnanimidad y desprendimiento el Dr. Fern\u00e1ndez es sin duda un fil\u00e1ntropo de la vida. Su predilecci\u00f3n por carreras de servicio y ayuda al pr\u00f3jimo y a la comunidad queda de manifiesto en su Curr\u00edculum Vitae: estudi\u00f3 Medicina, Filosof\u00eda y Letras y Psicolog\u00eda de la Educaci\u00f3n, adem\u00e1s de Administraci\u00f3n de Empresas, Econom\u00eda, Direcci\u00f3n de Centros, Direcci\u00f3n de Recursos Humanos, Literatura y otras disciplinas, en reconocidas universidades de Espa\u00f1a, Inglaterra, Estados Unidos y otros pa\u00edses europeos.\n\nSu gran sensibilidad ante la indefensi\u00f3n de las personas, los animales y las plantas ante la agresiva vida cotidiana, le convierte en un proselitista de vocaci\u00f3n. Posee la capacidad de una inteligencia superior; esto lo enmarca en un cuadro de honor existencial y defiende con dulzura y humildad, no exenta de firmeza, empe\u00f1o y sagacidad sus conocimientos y postulados sobre la creaci\u00f3n y organizaci\u00f3n de los Universos, de las criaturas que los pueblan, de las filosof\u00edas y doctrinas religiosas, a la vez que se confiesa fervoroso defensor de los derechos de la vida."

My entry into the token turned my $200 investment into $5,000 in 3 days as Keanu made a big launch run. \n\nAs with most of these stories however, I did NOT take profit. \n\nWithin days my investment was down to $1,000 and while still way up it was not $5,000 anymore. I told a developer who I had befriended and he said, and I\u2019m quoting, \u201cwell don\u2019t sell because if you do you\u2019ll lose your position and may not be able to get it back.\u201d\n\nI had been indoctrinated into the Cult of HODL and it made no sense. But I was a neophyte learning on the job. I continued to just HODL and share tweets on my Twitter page. \n\nThere was nobody covering Keanu on YouTube, however, so I made the jump into that forum and started doing daily videos. \n\nKeanu started to lose support and I branched out to other projects to cover. In the meantime Keanu failed and didn\u2019t go forward because they got into a bad deal with an unknown commodity and we all moved on. \n\nFast forward to today and we are now covering all of YOUR favorite cryptos in the space. I believe that I can assist and aid you in being able to READ your own charts, and REACT to what you are seeing so that YOU are able to choose the best projects and best entry points for your own portfolio. \n\nThank you for giving me the time of day it means so much."

Eisenhower was President of these United States -- to a music-teaching mother and a librarian-turned-politician father. \n\nGrowing up in Brooklyn, NY, Chris Owens and his two brothers, Geoffrey and Mitty, could have been a folk or classical ensemble.  Each brother played a stringed instrument, percussion and sang.  But they also liked to rock ... and pop ... and funk.  So, Geoffrey learned guitar (but still plays viola) , Chris traded in the piano, clarinet and cello for an electronic keyboard (but still plays recorders), violinist Millard focused on percussion \u2013 and, to start with, they all embraced the Jackson 5 and The Beatles!\n\nChris has performed solo, with his own bands, and with other singer-songwriters and choruses.  Chris formed OBB - The Owens Brothers Band in 2014, following the deaths within three months of his father, Congressman Major Owens (D-Brooklyn, NY), South African President and freedom fighter Nelson Mandela, and the one and only Pete Seeger.  OBB made its debut during \"SeegerFest\" at several venues, including Lincoln Center\u2019s Damrosch Park (NY). \n\nCOVID-19 has now created a new world, for better or for worse.  Having lost his wife of 28 years to cancer in 2019, Chris decided that COVID needed to create new lives, not just terrorize and take lives.  Furthermore, now that the internet rules the arts, it was clear that there are too many performers named \"Chris Owens\u201d!\n\nThus, Chris Oledude has been born.  With the recording and release of \"My Tower,\" Chris Oledude starts a new chapter in his life with an \"old school\" blend of blues, gospel, R&B, rock ... and Broadway.  \"My Tower\" is a catchy condemnation of COVID-19.\n\nThroughout the years, Chris Oledude's music has blended original melodies and rhythms with hot solos, harmonies and topical lyrics to create powerful and memorable songs.  Songs like \u201cMan O\u2019War,\u201d \u201cIf A Woman Had Made The World\u201d, and \u201cLove Is The Way\u201d are compelling and danceable social statements, while \"Black-Eyed Susan\" is a ballad like no other."

I started Rialto Marketing in 2013 and have been helping B2B professional service firms that want to accelerate revenue growth and attract more ideal clients. I believe marketing shouldn't be difficult. But, you must remove your revenue roadblocks if you want to grow consistently and predictably."

While processing regular payroll checks, she noticed the frequency of requests for final termination checks, which made her realize the instability of regular employment. This motivated her to start her own business, where she could control her own retirement by terminating herself.\n\nWhile still studying accounting, Elaine took various taxation courses and started her part-time tax business while working at a major 5 CPA firm. A few years later, she became a partner and CFO in a 5-star interior design firm that focused on designing new and refurbished 5-star hotels worldwide. Unfortunately, the late '90s recession and Gulf War forced the firm to close, leaving Elaine with a weekly unemployment income of $420.\n\nWith three children, a house, two dogs, a boat, and a Mercedes Benz, Elaine sold her luxury items, cashed in her retirement plans, and received financial help from family to start her own full-time tax business. She converted her garage into an office and promoted every knowledge she had under one roof, including bookkeeping, payroll, income taxes, sales taxes, business taxes, bankruptcy, forms, consultation, setting up corporations and nonprofit organizations, business plans, grant writing, tax problem resolution, life insurance, and even real estate.\n\nElaine and her brother distributed flyers and looked in publications for new business registrations, attended SCORE business meetings, and community meetings during the rebuild LA era to connect with construction clients who needed financials and taxes for loans. Her dedication paid off, as she built a solid business relationship with clients by going above and beyond their expectations, resulting in an excellent referral process that still exists today."

Every new client is informed that there are no guarantees for profit or that any past performances can be counted on toward futures results. They provide full disclosure that gambling is dangerous, but can be a lot of fun if done in a very disciplined manner.\n\n The key to benefiting from the JRS team\u2019s algorithm programs and database systems is to consistently invest the same amount of money on each selection. This process will ensure that the client\u2019s bankroll their investment return will be fully optimized.\n\nThese quantitative methods eliminate any human subjectivity from all selection processes. The base computer systems are based on combinatorial algorithms and an adaptive-structure Neural Network. In summary, our systems calculate and analyze several million pieces of game data and then optimizes the data to produce the best possible forecasts. The systems also optimize team streaks and momentum much like their technical analysis of a stock, futures, or even bitcoin.\n\n As seen in the financial markets for decades and personally learned from a vast investment banking career on Wall Street, the team applies a contrarian weighting to the betting consensus and team trends. For example, if a given trend in any sport is posting a 15-2 ATS, then the model may project that the trend has topped and is more likely to reverse.\n\nThen, the team quantifies and compares the game matchups. The top matchups supporting the pick are then detailed in the comprehensive report that is provided for each selection. These reports will concisely state why a given team has been selected and once you have read through the report your mind will be filled with the confidence and trust to invest your hard-earned money too.  \n\nJRS is a cutting-edge technology company whose sports information is unique, informative, and has produced strong predictive results. The key is committing to a full season. If you make that decision, you will not be disappointed. After all, they have been around for 22 years with a proven track record of success and treating clients with the respect that it takes hard work week after week and not with the hype of a Game of the Month or Game of the Year Lock."

Joshua's story is a testament to the transformative power of perseverance, hard work, and personal evolution.\n\nRaised in an environment that instilled the values of hard work and entrepreneurship, Joshua found himself navigating a path filled with challenges early on. The loss of his father at a young age was a harsh blow, but it fueled a determination to strive for a better life. From running a worm farm to shoveling snow, Joshua's entrepreneurial spirit was sparked from a young age, reflecting his grit and resilience.\n\nDespite facing significant challenges during his school years, Joshua discovered his potential at 18. His renewed determination led him to not only graduate but also meet his future mentor at Lowe's - a real estate tycoon who would significantly shape his professional journey.\n\nHowever, life wasn't a smooth journey for Joshua. Poor decisions and overconfidence led to significant losses and a period of despair. It was a downward spiral that saw him lose trust, indulge in unhealthy habits, and hit rock bottom. His life took a positive turn when he met his future wife, who inspired him to get back on track and work towards self-improvement.\n\nAs Joshua strove to regain control over his life, he ventured into the world of internet marketing. Although he invested in various online ventures, self-sabotage often stopped him from achieving success. But instead of giving up, he took these setbacks as lessons.\n\nToday, Joshua is a beacon of hope and resilience. Having reconciled with his past, he stands as the Chief Marketing Officer of Everlasting Creators, putting his hard-earned wisdom to work. He cherishes the guidance of industry leaders like John Thornhill, Omar Martin, and Anik Singal, advocating for dedication, consistency, and focus as the keys to success.\n\nJoshua's journey is an inspiration to all who encounter obstacles in their path. He firmly believes in the potential within each individual, encapsulated in his mantra, \"You Got This, I Believe in You!\" Joshua's life is a story of redemption and resurgence, a shining example that change is possible for anyone who genuinely desires it."

He received over 40,000 USD Fulbright Foreign Language Teaching Assistant (FLTA) Scholarship, the most prestigious in the world to teach Swahili language and African culture at Marshall University in Huntington, West Virginia (United States).

He got admission to the University of San Diego at the Joan B Kroc School of Peace to pursue his master\u2019s degree. He was awarded a 36,000 USD Joan B Kroc Peace Scholarship for tuition and fees, and a 24,000 USD Rotary Ambassadorial Scholarship to cover living expenses in the great state of California in the United States as an International Student. In total, he was awarded 60,000 USD for a master\u2019s degree.\n\n Ernest has been a scholarship and immigration blogger since 2007 and later started the EBM SCHOLARS and EBM SWAHILI YouTube channels.

I also have developed a wonderful network of friends, peers and acquaintances and it all stems from that one trait that has now become my superpower:  Curiosity. \n\nMy first career was in journalism.  I spent over a decade working at newspapers:  The Toronto Star, The St. Catharines Standard, The Hamilton Spectator and The Windsor Star.  I then delved into a few different careers:  Bed and Breakfast proprietor;  fundraiser; advertising and promotions manager in the fields of insurance and technology -  and now, an entrepreneur with my own company GailNow, for which I\u2019ve given myself the title of CCO - Chief Curiosity Officer.. \n\nTackling tough, controversial topics and issues sidestepped by the mainstream press is part of Curious Minds. . When I attended journalism school, I was taught to question authority, ask hard questions and get to the crux of the story in the most objective way possible.  \n\nAnd my forum to do so is my new YouTube show:   Curious Minds with GailNow"

Luchar por los ni\u00f1os y las causas perdidas ,ha sido un norte, Atraves de la radio y las redes, he logrado dar cabida aquellos que no tienen voz. Y creo que es el camino,a pesar que con ello no se gana mucho. Pero tienes la satisfaccion, de la risa en aquellos que sufren. \nPapa y muy pap\u00e1 de los mios. Fiel a los principios y tambi\u00e9n a las reglas,\nPero condescendiente, cuando veo que hay oportunidad ,creo en eso , pero cuando ya es mucho ,dejo de lado. Me aburre el quedarse estancado  y no avanzar .me atribule cuando ves las soluciones y por falta de voluntad no las tomas. \nA pesar de ser algo solitario ,me va bien cuando por ello.se logran objetivos ...aunque debo reconocer, que cuando ocurre lo contrario ,me vengo al suelo, medito en demas\u00eda y luego vamos caminando otra vez ...siempre hay manera y lucho por buscarla \nSoy como todos, pero aveces siento algo de mala suerte ..."
