> > Rebecca Kohler, celebrated as one of the premiere Canadian stand-up comics, recently brought her writing talents to the States working on the CBS comedy HAPPY TOGETHER.  Her stand-up style balances her innate benevolence with a tongue like an acid attack as she dissects the darkness of life's truths while maintaining a cheeky adorability.  Rebecca's stand-up career turned to television writing after she was named Toronto's Best Female Comic in 2013.  From there she staffed on CTV's sitcom SPUN OUT and POP's SCHITT'S CREEK.

He's been a main stage performer at UCB since 2013. He last staffed as a Producer on GIRLFRIEND'S GUIDE TO DIVORCE before taking some time off to raise his two young daughters while writing from home and selling more pilots.

His previous writing credits include CRISTELA, LAST MAN STANDING and MALIBU COUNTRY. He studied Writing for Film and Television at Emerson College and grew up in Warwick, Rhode Island. Outside of work, D.J. has performed stand-up to crowds of other stand-ups and angry bar patrons. It was a humbling experience that made him never want to do stand-up again. He has also been in several bands, plays guitar, and eats a lot of good food. And yes, people frequently think he's a DJ. And no, he's not named after D.J. Tanner. But he will cordially laugh at your joke about it.

Just months after finishing her graduate degree in screenwriting at UCLA, she was asked to join the staff of Disney Animation's TANGLED (based on the hit feature).

> > LOWER-LEVEL
> > Claytia Gonsalves (Diverse)                        GOOD KARMA
> > Born to Trinidadian and Jamaican parents, Claytia Gonsalves is originally from Central Florida by way of Brooklyn, NY. After graduating from Georgetown University with a degree in Culture and Politics, she was supposed to join the Foreign Service, travel the world, and kiss babies. While it was her interest in diplomacy that first attracted her to D.C., it was her love for humanity that inevitably drew her to film and TV. She discovered the power of storytelling and performance and hasn't looked back since. She's since written, directed, and produced for both film and theater and competed nationally as a spoken word poet with The Corpus Collective.  Claytia also won the 2019 ABFF/WarnerMedia Comedy Writing Competition for her original pilot Good Karma. She now strives to create catharsis-inducing work, reminding us to cry, fear, laugh, and breathe. But maybe not all at the same time... Claytia previously assisted director/producer Stan Lathan, and is now the Production & Development Coordinator at Kevin Hart's Laugh Out Loud Network. In her free time, she runs a writers group of up-and-comers in L.A.; but her most notable credit to date is as mother to a beautifully boisterous three-year-old girl.

> > Josephine Green Zhang (Diverse)              THE GOLDEN AGE
> > Josephine Green Zhang was most recently the showrunner's assistant on ABC's MIXED-ISH. She studied film and screenwriting at UCLA, despite her Taiwanese immigrant mother's hope that she would become a nun with a law degree. Originally from the Latinx and Asian communities of the San Gabriel Valley, she has lived in both Chile and China (where she met her native-Chinese spouse on the dance floor of an American hip-hop club), and incorporates her multicultural experiences and her own immigrant upbringing into her work. She's been a screenwriter in the Universal Writers program; a Film Independent Project: Involve Fellow; a Sprite Film Finalist; and a recipient of the Peter Stark Memorial Scholarship. She also writes and performs sketch comedy with her all-female sketch group, Glamazon. Ultimately, Josephine aspires to create stories which empower characters to find their own happy endings - with a special focus on loud, strong, and funny women. In addition to grounded and broad comedy, Josephine loves writing stories that mix and challenge genres. She recently directed an all-female cast in a film noir spoof entitled "The Dick Pickford Detective Agency;" it is currently in the festival circuit and won one of the best film awards at the Broad Humor Film Festival.
