# Finance Routes Migration Summary

## âœ… Completed Migration

We've successfully migrated the finance routes from Fastify to Hono, breaking them down into focused, single-responsibility files:

### New Route Structure

```
apps/api/src/routes/finance/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts                     # Main finance router (combines all routes)
â”œâ”€â”€ finance-institutions.ts     # GET /institutions
â”œâ”€â”€ finance-transactions.ts     # CRUD for transactions
â”œâ”€â”€ finance-imports.ts          # CSV import functionality  
â”œâ”€â”€ finance-categories.ts       # GET /categories
â””â”€â”€ finance-data.ts            # DELETE all finance data
```

### Route Mappings

| Route | Method | Description | Status |
|-------|--------|-------------|---------|
| `/api/finance/institutions` | GET | Get all financial institutions | âœ… Migrated |
| `/api/finance/transactions` | GET | Query transactions with filters | âœ… Migrated |
| `/api/finance/transactions` | POST | Create new transaction | âœ… Migrated |
| `/api/finance/transactions/:id` | PUT | Update transaction | âœ… Migrated |
| `/api/finance/transactions/:id` | DELETE | Delete transaction | âœ… Migrated |
| `/api/finance/imports` | POST | Import CSV transactions | âœ… Migrated |
| `/api/finance/imports/:jobId` | GET | Check import status | âœ… Migrated |
| `/api/finance/imports/active` | GET | Get active import jobs | âœ… Migrated |
| `/api/finance/categories` | GET | Get spending categories | âœ… Migrated |
| `/api/finance/data` | DELETE | Delete all finance data | âœ… Migrated |

### Key Improvements

1. **Modular Architecture**: Each route file has a single responsibility
2. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with Zod validation
3. **Modern Patterns**: Uses Hono's middleware and routing patterns
4. **Authentication**: Consistent auth middleware across all routes
5. **Error Handling**: Standardized error responses
6. **File Upload**: Updated to work with native Request API

### Technical Details

- **Framework**: Migrated from Fastify to Hono
- **Validation**: Using `@hono/zod-validator` for request validation
- **Authentication**: Context-based user data (`c.get('userId')`)
- **File Upload**: Updated middleware to use native `FormData` API
- **Queue Integration**: BullMQ queues accessible via context variables

## ðŸ”„ Still Pending Migration

These finance sub-routes still need conversion:

```
- budget.router.ts          # Budget management routes
- finance-accounts.ts       # Account management routes  
- finance-analyze.ts        # Analytics and reporting routes
- finance-export.ts         # Export functionality
- plaid.router.ts          # Plaid integration routes
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing

The server runs on port 4040 and all migrated routes are properly protected with authentication:

```bash
# Test server is running
curl http://localhost:4040/api/health

# Test finance routes (requires auth)
curl http://localhost:4040/api/finance/institutions
# Returns: {"error":"Missing or invalid authorization header"}
```

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

1. **Convert remaining finance routes**: Budget, Accounts, Analytics, Export, Plaid
2. **Add comprehensive tests**: Unit and integration tests for all routes
3. **Performance optimization**: Add caching where appropriate
4. **Documentation**: Add OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
5. **Rate limiting**: Fine-tune rate limits for different endpoints
