- Added packages/db/generate-types.ts to parse schema files with TypeScript AST and extract exported pgTable declarations.
- Script defaults to dry-run, reports file/table counts, and skips schema files without pgTable exports.
- Type names are derived via singularized PascalCase with overrides for events -> CalendarEvent, userLists -> UserList, contentStrategies -> ContentStrategy, and transactions -> FinanceTransaction.
- Generated content includes the AUTO-GENERATED header and imports tables from ../src/schema/{domain}.
