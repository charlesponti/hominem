# Rules to Follow for Clean and Performant Software

## General Principles
1. **Code Clarity**: Write code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain.
2. **Consistent Formatting**: Use consistent formatting across your project to improve readability.
3. **Avoid Magic Numbers**: Avoid using numbers or strings without context in the code.
4. **DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Do not repeat yourself by reusing code where possible.
5. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class, function, or module should have a single responsibility.
6. **KISS Principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Keep things simple and avoid unnecessary complexity.
7. **YAGNI Principle (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Do not implement features until you need them.
8. **SOLID Principles**: Follow the Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion principles.

## Design Patterns
9. **Factory Pattern**: Use a factory to create objects without specifying their concrete classes.
10. **Singleton Pattern**: Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.
11. **Observer Pattern**: Define a dependency between an object that sends messages and the object(s) receiving these messages.
12. **Strategy Pattern**: Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.
13. **Decorator Pattern**: Dynamically add responsibilities to objects without altering their structure.

## Performance Optimization
14. **Avoid Premature Optimization**: Focus on writing correct code first; optimize later if necessary.
15. **Use Efficient Data Structures**: Choose the right data structures for your use case (e.g., lists, sets, maps).
