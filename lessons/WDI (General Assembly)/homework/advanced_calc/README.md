  CalcIt Lab - Trip Calculator (Homework)

Trip Calculator:
   This option asks the user for four inputs:

   Distance – how far will you drive?
   MPG – what is the fuel efficiency of the car?
   $PG – how much does gas cost per gallon?
   Speed – how fast will you drive?

   The output is a string: “Your trip will take 3.5 hours and cost $255.33.”

   For every 1 MPH over 60 MPH, reduce the the MPG by 2 MPG. 
   (i.e. a car that normally gets 30 mpg would only get 28 mpg if its speed were 61 mph. 
   Yes this gets silly at high speed where mpg goes to zero or gets negative.)
