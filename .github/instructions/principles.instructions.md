This file is deprecated. Canonical engineering rules, style, and testing guidance were consolidated into `AGENTS.md` under the "Universal Coding Principles (consolidated)" section.

If you need to update repo-wide principles, edit `AGENTS.md`. During the transition you may leave a short "See also" pointer here back to `AGENTS.md`, but avoid duplicating content to prevent drift.
