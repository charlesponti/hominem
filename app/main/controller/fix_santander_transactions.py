"""
I created this because when exporting transactions for Santander bank,
some dates are written as `DAY/MONTH/YEAR` which confuses spreadsheet
applications such as Google Sheets.

For example, if you attempt to format the Date column without converting these
date values, the spreadsheet application will attempt to find a month `25` and
day `12` for `25/12/2020`.
