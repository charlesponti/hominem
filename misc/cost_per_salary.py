# While listening to the Dave Ramsey Show, he discussed how someone who
# earns $42,000,000 spending $100,000 is equivalent to someone who
# earns $42,000 spending $10. It can be very difficult for people to wrap
# their minds around large numbers such as this, so I wanted to create
# something that would help with this mental framing.
